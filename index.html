		<h1>Introduction</h1> 
		<p>
		This class provides an introduction to working with information, data and visualization in a hands-on studio learning environment. Studies the history and theory of information, followed by a series of projects in which students apply the ideas directly. Progresses though basic data analysis, visual design and presentation, and more sophisticated interaction techniques. Topics include storytelling and narrative, choosing representations, understanding audiences, and the role of designers working with data.

		<h1><a name="01-clock">1. The Clock</a></h1> 
		<p>
		Create twelve different visual representations of a clock. This is a creative interpretation of the clock, focused on visual quality, aesthetics and inventiveness. Your interpretation needs to be legible to you (the author), and you need to be able to explain how the time is derived visually at any given point. Think about the different states of the clock. How do they represent the time, how does it look in different moments in time?

		<h1><a name="02-weather">2. Weather</a></h1> 
		<p>
		Create two designs for a weather app, one literal and one abstract. Create both of your two weather apps in P5. Design it for the mobile form factor and host it on your github.io page. It has to work and look good on your phone. Use data, design, motion and interactivity as you see fit to create the most compelling weather apps you can think of.

		<h1><a name="03-census">3. Census</a></h1> 
		<p>
			In this four week assignment you will visualize US Census data from CitySDK. You have the freedom to choose any subset of the data, and represent it any way you want. The open-ended nature of the assignment means that you have the responsibility of finding your own “story in the data”– one of the core tenets of the curriculum. 
		</p>
		</br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 1: Research, Concepts, Sketches</h2>
			Explore what is available as <a href="https://www.census.gov/developers/
">census data here</a>. Come up with three “stories” you are interested in. Create a name, description and  sketch for each and and find visual references. Submit one presentation on Stellar either as pdf or Google slides.
		</p>
		</br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 2: Parsing & First design iteration</h2>
			Decide on one of the 3 concepts. Take a deep dive into the data. Is the data available? How is it structured and what structure do you need to create your visualization? Are there other data that would complement your story? 
			This might be a bit of a tedious and messy process, as likely the data is not structured exactly how you need it. </br></br>
			Oftentimes you can actually download the data, then you can store the data locally as a csv or json file and don't need API calls. See <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/loadJSON">loadJSON()</a> and remember you will need to run a <a href="https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server">local server</a>. See below for some code examples.
			</br></br>
			In parallel, start working on a first design iteration for your visualization. Consider layout, information hierarchy, typography, color, interface elements and states of your application. Consider designing for desktop and mobile.

		</br>
		<p>
			<h2>Week 3: Prototype & Final design</h2>
			Create a working prototype of your visualization. This should be your “minimum viable product”. All pieces should be in place, your visualization strategy clear. Also create a “pixel perfect” visual design that defines all aspects in full detail.
		</p>
		</br>
		<h2>Code examples</h2> 
		<p>
			The examples below show using a modified csv downloaded from census.gov. Creating a graph for it, and filtering by state. There is also a choropleth map example, and an example that combines it all: A map and the custom data set and graph in one piece.</br></br>

		</p>

		</br>

		<p>
			<h2>Week 4: Refinement and final working app</h2>
			Bring all components together in one final developed version of your visualization. Consider responsive behavior, filtering, states and animation.
